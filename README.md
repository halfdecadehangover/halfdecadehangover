### I know you like big numbers 👀👀👀

I mostly use github for nerdy stuff not ponytown but whatever

This is intended for PonyTown players. If you do not play PonyTown, you may disregard this message.

🟢 = Likely online? || 🌙 = Offtab, Semi-afk, or tired... whispering is recommended || ⛔️ = AFK, please W2I

- I am open to making new friends. Just be nice ok
- If my pony is sleeping I am most likely AFK or Offtab!
- Feel free to cuddle or hide behind me, I do not mind. Best to ask first if I'm with a friend.
- I recommend you to whisper to interact because I'm mostly offtab or semi-afk,,,
- Feel free to take inspo, just try to use your own creavity okay? It's more fun that way.
- Please don't post me on Pinterest unless I allowed you to. Idc if its like a screenshot that has me but just don't post one of me specifically I'd be embarrassed
