## Hi there 👋

This is intended for PonyTown players. If you do not play PonyTown, you may disregard this message. ||
I am almost always open to making new friends. I won't be nice to you if you're not nice to me. Feel free to cuddle or hide behind me, I do not mind. I recommend you to whisper to interact because I'm mostly offtab or semi-afk.
Keep in mind I am much less formal when you actually talk to me. That really just depends on my mood though.
Feel free to take inspo, just try to use your own creavity okay? It's more fun that way. Please don't post me on Pinterest unless I allowed you to.

My favorite fandoms are:
My own OCs duh, Solarballs, CountryHumans, Guts and Blackpowder, Roblox, and Many more

If you want to know more just ask
