i mostly use github for nerdy stuff not ponytown but whatever.

This is intended for PonyTown players. If you do not play PonyTown, you may disregard this message.

🟢 = Likely online || 🌙 = Offtab or Semi-afk, whispering is recommended.. or I'm just tired || ⛔️ = AFK, please W2I

- I am almost always open to making new friends. I won't be nice to you if you're not nice to me. 
- Feel free to cuddle or hide behind me, I do not mind. Best to ask first if I'm with a friend.
- I recommend you to whisper to interact because I'm mostly offtab or semi-afk.
- Keep in mind I am much less formal when you actually talk to me. That really just depends on my mood though.
- Feel free to take inspo, just try to use your own creavity okay? It's more fun that way.
- Please don't post me on Pinterest unless I allowed you to. Idc if its like a screenshot with me but dont post about me specifically

My favorite fandoms are:
My own OCs duh, Solarballs, CountryHumans, Guts and Blackpowder, Roblox, and Many more

If you want to know more just ask.
